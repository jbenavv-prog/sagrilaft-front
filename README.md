Introduction

ArchitectUI Angular 9 Version
ArchitectUI Angular is built using Angular CLI and utilizes the latest versions of the Angular plugins included in the package.

Thanks to Angular CLI, ArchitectUI comes bundled and pre-configured with all the necessary configurations, NPM plugins and options, so you don't have to loose time setting those up in each of your projects.

For stylesheets it uses SASS which allowed us to build a better, more modular and scalable styles architecture. The modular SCSS files are compiled, minified and bundled automatically using Webpack.

All styles are standardised using ng-bootstrap which is a Bootstrap 4 port for Angular.

Installation
Download and uncompress the theme package archive in your desired folder location.

Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org/en/download/

Install the latest version of npm. This will be useful when running all the build commands. Run the following in a command line, either your IDE's Terminal window or in a Windows Command Prompt.

                                                            
    npm install --global npm@latest
                                                        


Install Angular CLI using NPM, if you don't have it already installed. More informations about Angular CLI installation are available here.

Run the following command to install Angular CLI from the command line:

npm install -g @angular/cli # OR yarn global add @angular/cli

Install the app dependencies by running the following command in the command line inside the folder root where you have unzipped the theme package archive.


    npm install
                                                        
After npm finishes installing the modules from package.json you can go ahead and start the application. To do so, run the command below.


    ng serve
